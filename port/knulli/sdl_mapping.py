"""Prints SDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG lines for the handheld's own controls,
from EmulationStation's controller configuration (port/knulli/README.md).

SDL2's built-in database takes the H700 handhelds' controls (all of them
report the same generic GUID) for an ODROID-GO 2 pad, with the wrong
buttons. EmulationStation knows each device's controls by name; this turns
the entry of every connected device into an SDL mapping, as Batocera's
emulator launcher does: EmulationStation's buttons are named by the
Nintendo layout (a on the right, b at the bottom), SDL's by the Xbox layout
(a at the bottom).
